            <h1>Our Histroy</h1>
            <p>The japenese Womens Leadership initiative (JWLI) was founded in 2006 by three visionary
                women in Boston, Massachusetts: Atsuko Toko Fish, Mary Lassen, and Catherine Crone Coburn. JWLI brings
                emerging
                women leaders, referred to as the fellows, from Japan to Boston to receive four weeks of hands-on
                experience and
                training with succsessful nonprofit organization in nonprofit managment and leadership development.
                During thier
                stay in Boston, the fellows will develop an action plan, which will serve as a step-by-step roadmap to
                make
                their dreams of social change a reality. After returning to Japan, the fellows are expected to make a
                difference
                in their communities based on thier action plans. The purpose of this program is for the fellows to
                share their
                knowledge and experience they acquired in Boston with other women and social sector leaders within
                Japan. The
                fish family foundation, opening in conjucntion with other Boston-based nonprofit organizations, is
                adminestering
                JWLI in partnership with Simmons collehe school of managment center for gender in organizations. In
                2010. thanks
                to the generous funding provided by the U.S- Japan foundation JWLI expanded its vision to hold public
                forums
                with Japan, held in 2010,2012 and 2013,these public forums provided information about the nonprofit
                sector and
                the American approach to Philanthropy with hopes to inspire women to take leadership roles. The forum
                program
                reached hundreds of japenese citizens, advocating for their involvment in addressin the needs of
                japenese
